# pythonSchool 
Here I backup my python codes from school + home.

# What are ch(n)?
ch(n) is short form of chapter. I wanted to keep the name according to function.
But then I decided to keep it according to book, so that it will be easier to find
answer to those questions.

# Is this high level shit?
Not at all.. very basic shit as of now! Maybe cool stuff will come in 12?
